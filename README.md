# Tabtip.Avalonia (Tablet Text Input Panel)

> Avalonia-based and cross-platform re-imagining of [WPFTabTip](https://github.com/maximcus/WPFTabTip)

### Why `TabTip`?

"TabTip" refers to the **Touch Keyboard and Handwriting Panel**, also known as the **Tablet Text Input Panel**, which is
a virtual keyboard in Windows.
Since this project was heavily inspired by the WPF version, the name is also inspired by the WPF version.
